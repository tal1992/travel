## What is Biodiversity?

Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. It includes all the different plants, animals, and fungi that live on our planet, as well as the ecosystems in which they live. Biodiversity is important for a number of reasons, including:

- It provides us with essential resources, such as food, water, and medicine.
- It helps to regulate the climate and clean the air and water.
- It is essential for human health and well-being.
- It is a source of inspiration and beauty.

## London's Habitats

London's biodiversity is supported by a diverse range of habitats, including:

### 1. Parks and Gardens

## Challenges to Biodiversity in London

Despite its rich biodiversity, London faces several challenges, including:

### 1. Habitat Loss and Fragmentation

Development pressure, climate change, and pollution contribute to the loss and fragmentation of habitats, posing a significant threat to biodiversity.

### 2. Invasive Species

Invasive species like the grey squirrel and Japanese knotweed can outcompete native species, reducing overall biodiversity.

### 3. Climate Change

Warmer temperatures and extreme weather events caused by climate change negatively impact London's plant and animal species.

## Conservation Efforts in London

Several organizations are working to protect and enhance London's biodiversity, including:

- The Greater London Authority, with policies like the London Biodiversity Action Plan.
